                    <h1>Poster for da:ns Festival 2022</h1>
                    <p>This poster was created for da:ns Festival 2023. <br><br>
                
                    For this poster, I aimed to target viewers who knew about contemporary dance, but were unfamiliar with it. I chose to use silhouettes for the dancers in order to keep the focus of the viewer on the shapes of the pose, rather than the identity of the dancers, so the viewer can tell that the event is about contemporary dance. It also made it easier for me to coordinate the colours as I did not have to worry about matching the various shades of colours on a real life image.<br><br>

                    Contemporary dance is a genre of dance that combines other genres like ballet and jazz to express various emotions, and the poses chosen are common contemporary dance moves. In order to emphasise on that, I used lighter shades of blue, yellow and red, otherwise known as pink because they each represent freedom, joy and playfulness. In addition to this, they are a triad of matching colours on the colour wheel. It also complimented the indigo blue background, which was chosen to represent water and how that the dances in this event can be seen as a reflection of oneself. The shadows behind the dance poses are meant to make the colours pop more. <br><br>
                    
                    For visibility of details like the text, I chose to use white as it contrasted well with the indigo blue. I used ripples to show the movements of the dancers, and lines to give the poster some flow. For the yellow dancer, I used dots instead of ripples to show the build-up to her jump split, and gave all the dancers extra lines to show the flow of them moving into the pose seen in the poster. I used brushes with a paintbrush-like texture so that I could represent the dancers as paintbrushes painting a story through their dance. All of these combines to give the image of the dancers dancing on water, which amplifies the graceful and elegant image o f their dances.

                    <h1>Namecard</h1>
                    <p>This namecard was created as part of my Graded Assignment for one of my modules.<br><br>
                        This design was created in order to present myself to potential clients or employers. For the front part
                        of the name card, I included the Elements of Design shape, line, and colour, which is demonstrated in
                        the irregular lines that make up the tree ring design. For the Principles of Design, I included contrast
                        and emphasis, which is shown in the use of a triadic colour scheme between green, purple and
                        orange. Emphasis can be seen in the way the tree rings lead the viewer's eye to the centre, where my
                        logo is.<br><br>
                        
                        For the back of my design, I used the Source Code Variable font as it is a font often used in code
                        editors, which is in turn associated with my job designation of choice, a Software Developer. I chose
                        white on the green background because white was more readable as compared to the other triad
                        colours. I used dark green outlines on the text in order to make the white less glaring for the viewer.
                        For my contact details, I included my phone number and official email. A QR code that links to my
                        contact details is included for the convenience of the viewer, as everything is becoming more
                        digitalised.</p>

                    <p>This is a magazine page that was created to feature the special parts of Okinawa's attractions.
                        One of the attractions of Okinawa is a shrine, so I decided to go with an ema, a wooden plaque theme to showcase the pictures.
                        I also felt that it would give the magazine a traditional look, which would resemble the shrine.

                    <h1>Mobile Portfolio Prototype</h1>
                    <p>This mobile portfolio was created for a Graded Assignment.<br><br>
                        <b>Theme and ideation:</b><br>
                        The theme of this design is Mirrors and Reflections, with a more abstract and elegant style.<br>
                        Reflection is important when learning, and this design aims to represent this belief in both a literal and figurative sense, which is why this theme was chosen. At the same time, the mirror is meant to represent the human mind and body. By using this theme, the designer hopes to show that even the broken shards of a mirror is still part of the mirror and should not be thoughtlessly done away with just because it is broken, uneven or useless.
                        It also aims to present the designer’s view of the world by telling a brief story through this portfolio application.<br><br>
                        
                        
                        <b>Design principle:</b><br>
                        In this design, the Design principles Rhythm, Contrast, and Emphasis were used.<br>
                        Rhythm can be seen in the way the mirror shards are placed; The animations added to the buttons contribute to this as well.
                        Contrast can be seen in the way colours are used. The main colours used are a darker shade of greenish blue () and greenish white (). A glowing effect is added to the hover state of the shards are created to help the shards stand out against the dark background. At the same time, it also contrasts with the sharp edges of the mirror shards as the blur applied to achieve the glow effect softens the overall look.
                        Emphasis can be seen in the way the shards are of different sizes depending on which page they are in. In the Portfolio category page, the shards are bigger to represent the categories, while the shards that contain my past works are smaller in comparison
